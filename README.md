###User Stories

-As a user I want to be able to register my band and login to a page where fans can enter their email, so I can put my laptop out on the merch table at shows to act as a signup sheet.

-As a user I want to be able to sign in as an admin to remove entries from the list if necessary. I want this to be a separate sign in feature because not everyone needs to have the option to remove.
